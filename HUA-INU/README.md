#### Timeline
- A HUAHUA-INU developer came in contact with the team in order to seek for a partnership into funding a Chihuahua Dex some weeks ago, the developer shared its long term views and excitement about Chihuahua in a chat with some community manager and started working on his project.
- The project launched on the 13/11/2022 and was hosted on https://huainu.wtf
- After a few hours the website, the GitHub repository and the Twitter account went dark, the scammer managed to pull and dump approximately 183M $HUAHUA (27,000 USD) that were subsequentially laundered and sent to a Binance Wallet. [Here's the tracking](https://twitter.com/Rarma_/status/1591974073537789953?t=ofzDHbrjkrUHqeCJKJJk3Q&s=19)

#### Information Gathering
The Chihuahua Community was quick to react and tried to collect as many details as possible.
- It started by performing a [domain whois](https://www.whois.com/whois/huainu.wtf), and since the registrar is based in the United States we promptly got in touch with them to [notify](https://twitter.com/Porkbun/status/1591957375933902848) the abuse.
- A [reverse IP](https://reverseip.domaintools.com/search/?q=huainu.wtf) lookup of the website pointed to a hosting provider located in Hanoi, Vietnam
- The PDF Data from the project's pitch deck [showed](https://twitter.com/0xponci/status/1591933994605633537) it was created using Canva and the Author name pointed to a Vietnamese person named **Nguyễn Hoàng Minh** which is a fairly common name in Vietnam.
- A user with the same name and, quoting from the (now removed) [Linkedin Profile](https://vn.linkedin.com/in/nghminh163) stated to have "Participated in a number of projects such as building Liquidity Pool, Swapping system" and to have "Knowledge about Web3 and DeFi, Smart Contract on EVM, Solana Chain and Terra Chain."
- Further analysis brought us to the alleged scammer [github account](https://github.com/nghminh163/nghminh163) which revealed lot of personal details such as, [Facebook](https://facebook.com/nhm163), [e-mail](mailto:nghminh163@outlook.com) and the now removed [Linkedin Profile](https://vn.linkedin.com/in/nghminh163)
- The stolen funds were finally [tracked](https://twitter.com/Rarma_/status/1591974073537789953?t=ofzDHbrjkrUHqeCJKJJk3Q&s=19) and likely ended up on Binance.
- Digging deeper allowed us to find a connection between HUA-INU scam and [DaisyFinance scam on JunoNetwork](https://github.com/DaisyFinance/Asset-List)

#### Confrontation Attempt
The ChihuahuaTeam and many users from the community tried to [get in contact](https://twitter.com/TheVinhNguyen4/status/1591986704478777344) with the user via his [brand new Twitter account](https://twitter.com/NguyenH99678839) for a confrontation asking him to reach to a Community Manager or the Team. We received no response except from the one publicly available on Twitter.

#### Conclusion
Being a permissionless blockchain we all have no final word on any independent project/developer developing and building on top of ChihuahuaChain. That's the price and the downside of being free and permissionless. We strongly believe that this will serve as a lesson for future projects launching on ChihuahuaChain and a warning for all of the Community, we should all do our own research and due diligence before investing our money on any project, on ChihuahuaChain and in any other blockchain and real business in general. As a result, the Chihuahua Team and the Community Managers will stop any kind of advertisement on any public medium from projects coming from unknown or anonynmous devs. 

We will still try to contact the alleged scammer in order to get back the funds before notifying Binance and the relevant authorities.
At this point **we have no evidence that the scammer is the person where all the clues are pointing the finger at**. We are confident that Binance might be able to freeze the assets and start an internal investigation that will lead to the real person behind the scam.
